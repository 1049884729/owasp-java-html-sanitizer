The release script will create a new maven <version>.
To do so, it copies the directory structure under
    owasp-java-html-sanitizer/owasp-java-html-sanitizer/+++version+++
and rewrites them as below

It then rewrites
    owasp-java-html-sanitizer/owasp-java-html-sanitizer/maven-metadata.xml
to make sure the version list is up-to-date.


====================
Rewriting file paths
====================
Within a file path, field names surrounded by three pluses are replaced.
So if the timestamp field is 19700101120000 then "/foo/+++timestamp+++.txt"
becomes "/foo/19700101120000.txt".


======================
Rewriting file content
======================
Any line containing
    <!--##REPLACE##...##END##-->
is replaced with
    ... <!--##REPLACE##...##END##-->
where the first ... has +++fields+++ expanded.

Any line containing
    ##DUPE##...##END##
is output unchanged but preceded by ... with ++fields+++ expanded.


=================
Field definitions
=================
+++version+++ : The SVN version, like r123.
+++timestamp+++ : The current time in UTC in YYYYMMDDhhmmss format.
